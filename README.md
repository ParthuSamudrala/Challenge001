# Technical Challenge

Challenge #1: Both the CloudFormation script and it's parameter along with the AWS CLI command are prefixed 'Challange1_'.

Challenge #2: Considered instance meta data to output a filed in the same directory where script is run. Out put is cat-ed once the script is executed.

Challenge #3: Code worked well with few test cases.

I thoroughly enjoyed all the challenges. Please feel free to add comments once evaluated. Thank you!
