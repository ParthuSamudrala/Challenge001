# Technical Challenge
Challenge #1: The idea is to create web application in public subnet with ALB exposed to the internet and Frontend, backend and DB to be provisioned in private subnets in a single stack. I have added both CFS as seperate files, in the next commit I will try to club both the staks.

    1. File Name: Challange1awscli-cfs.json (Multi tier web application stack provisioning is triggered using the cli)
    
    2. File Name: Challange1_TheeTierArch.json (Simple three tier architecture CFS)

Challenge #2: Considered instance meta data to output a filed in the same directory where script is run. Out put is cat-ed once the script is executed.

Challenge #3: Code worked well with few test cases.

I thoroughly enjoyed all the challenges. Please feel free to add comments once evaluated. Thank you!
